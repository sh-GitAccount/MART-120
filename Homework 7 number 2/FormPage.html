<div> You find yourself stranded alone on an island, you don't know how you got here, or where "here" is, but it's not so bad because they have a snack bar and an Elvis impersonator.<br>
Panic grips you, in a rush you quickly check your handy fanny-pack, you reach in and retrieve your - </div>

<select id ="refrigerator" name="fridgeChocie">
  <option value="option1">Horse Meat</option>
  <option value="option2">Dijon Mustard</option>
  <option value="option3">Leftover Pickle Juice</option> 
  <option value="option4">Questionable yogurt container</option> 
  <option value="option5">The last swig of milk</option> 
</select>
<br>

 <p class="Bright"> Did you pick the milk?</p>
  <input type = "radio" id = "yes" name = "choice" value = "yes">
  <label for = "yes"> Yes </label> 
  <input type = "radio" id = "no" name = "choice" value = "no">
  <label for = "no"> No </label>
<br>

<ul class="Bright"> Of course you did. Everyone keeps a 6% remaining swig of milk in their fanny pack when they go to bed. 
  <br>You feel a wave of relief wash over you, knowing that you are stranded on this island not alone, but with
  <br> your cherished family heirloom of 2.3 mouthfuls of milk. As you walk towards the snackbar, an overpowering smell breaches your nostrils, it's.... 
  <br>
<br>
  <input type="radio" name ="Smell" value="Fresh cut grass"> Fresh cut grass. <br>
  <input type="radio" name ="Smell" value="Apple Pie"> Apple pie.<br>
  <input type="radio" name ="Smell" value="Previously wet but now dry dog"> Previously wet but now dry dog.<br>
  <input type="radio" name ="Smell" value="Teen spirit"> Teen spirit. <br>
  <input type="radio" name ="Smell" value="Rock"> What the Rock is cookin'. <br>

</ul>

<ul class="Bright"> Of course that's what it was! You're well acquianted with that particular smell having had the thing in the past <br>
  make this relevant to whichever item you choses. Speaking of, as you approach the snack bar Elvis steps up
  <br> and asks you in a very Elvis way "Why did you bring that milk with you?"
  <br>
    <input type="checkbox" name="reason" value="Tasty"> I just love the way it tastes. <br>
    <input type="checkbox" name="reason" value="And"> It's useful for self defense.<br>
    <input type="checkbox" name="reason" value="Granny"> Just like grandma used to make.<br>
    <input type="checkbox" name="reason" value="Health"> And it's a great way to stay in shape. <br>
</ul>

<ul class="Bright">As you turn your gaze towards this extraordinarily hairy Elvis impersonator, you realize that you're not at the beach at all. 
  <br>You're in Walmart holding up the self checkout line, 
  <br>staring at a gallon of milk. You quickly glance around before scanning the milk with the thing. 
  <br>As you do, the beeping doesn't stop. You scan it again and the beeping intensifies. 
  <br>You look into the scanner and it scans your eyes. 
  <br>The light is blinding. You rub your eyes in response and are suddenly jolted awake. </p></ul>

<h2> Wow what a great story, thanks! Here is an art that my friend Claudia made.</h2>
