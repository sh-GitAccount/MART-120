The difference between a GUI and CLI is that one is simply prettier to look at and easier to understand. You need far less knowledge to utilize a GUI, as everything you do in a CLI is done via entereing commands/prompts directly. Going to user "C:\Users\Steven\Documents\CD Projekt Red" is far easier by just clicking on the file navigator in the graphical interface than it is to type in directory commands. However you can create very powerful tools using cli files which essentially the sky is the limit for especially with powershell and other utilities. I always will prefer a GUI over a CLI though, CLI to me feels archaic and outdated.
